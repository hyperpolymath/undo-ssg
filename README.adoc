**Reversible static site generation in the Arrow language.**
"undo" — The trajectory of reversible logic. A generator that moves forward to build and backwards to un-build.

== Who Is This For?
* **Reversible computing researchers** seeking zero-entropy site synthesis.
* **Systems Engineers** targeting **ASICs** where thermal efficiency is the primary constraint.
* **Verification Purists** requiring isomorphic mappings between source and output.

== Why undo-ssg?
=== Information Preservation
Unlike traditional SSGs that "lose" source data during rendering, `undo-ssg` is built in a reversible language. Every build step is an isomorphism; the HTML output contains the mathematical potential to reconstruct the source markdown exactly.

=== Zero-Entropy Logic
Reversible operations avoid the energy cost of erasing information. `undo-ssg` is designed for high-efficiency hardware and **Edge tech** deployments where heat dissipation is a failure state.

=== Deterministic Inversion
"Un-call" a procedure to revert a site build to its previous state with mathematical certainty. No more partial state corruption during failed deployments.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Bootstrap the Arrow/Janus environment via asdf
just setup

# Build the site forward
just build-forward

# Reverse the build to verify source integrity
just build-backward
----

== Features
* **Isomorphic Synthesis** - 1:1 mapping between source and rendered state.
* **Thermodynamic Efficiency** - Near-zero energy dissipation for Edge hardware.
* **Podman-First** - Isolated, reversible build environments.
* **Accessibility** - Integrated support for **BSL**, **GSL**, **ASL**, and **Makaton**.

== Requirements
* **Arrow/Janus Interpreter**
* **Just** (Orchestrator)
* **Podman** (Container Engine)

== Part of poly-ssg
`undo-ssg` is the reversible, zero-entropy member of the **poly-ssg** family.
